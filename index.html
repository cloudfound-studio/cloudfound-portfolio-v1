                        Hi, I’m Jacob – a computer science student who builds clean, responsive
                        websites that feel calm, clear, and easy to use. I focus on local service businesses:
                        trades, salons, studios, and other small teams that don’t have an in-house “web person”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You get someone who actually answers emails, explains things in plain language,
                        and cares about how your site feels for real customers.
